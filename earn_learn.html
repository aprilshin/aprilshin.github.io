    <section class="overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The University of Michigan (UM) is a reputable, well-rounded school with over 50,000 students and faculties.
        All
        graduate programs including engineering, law, business, information, public policy, social work and more, are
        mostly
        ranked top 10 in the states.
        <br><br>One day, when I had hard time figuring out how to solve issues in carrying out my website
        coding, I thought, ‘Since we have so many intelligent students from such a wide range of disciplines, <span
          class="bold">what if I could
          have a peer tutor from someone who can help me out on the specific problems that I’m having?’, ‘what if UM
          students
          could exchange or teach each other's knowledge and skills according to their learning needs?’</span>

        <br><br>I decided to take this questions for my individual project in class <span class="italic">SI 582:
          Introduction to Interaction Design</span>, taught
        by <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyamccarley/">Professor McCarley</a>.
        In fact, I realized that many
        UM students have been raising the similar questions when <span class="bold">they fail to get help from school
          resources or finding a right person who can work on their problems together.</span>


        <br><br>Based on tailored research, I finally created “Earn & Learn” , an application that connects UM students
        based on
        individual’s needs for learning. Learning subjects could be anything from courseworks to technical skills, and
        students
        can be both a tutor and tutee. The application was presented at the final presentation during the class, and
        <span class="bold">received
          an “A” in overall evaluation</span>.

      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Earn & Learn allows users to get connected among UM students in order to:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>1) exchange each other’s needed knowledge for free
          <br>2) find a credible peer tutor nearby at affordable price
          <br>3) become a tutor to gain teaching experiences and make money

      </figure> -->
    </section>
    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I followed the user-centered approach as below:
        <figure>
          <img class="rwd-img" src="el_contents/approach.png" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
          <!-- <figcaption class="figcaption">User Scenario explaining how users can achieve their goals through the
            service.</figcaption> -->
        </figure>
        <p>
          <br><br>When I approached the problem, Professor Mccarley highly emphasized the following:
          
          <br><br><span class="italic">“ ... I don’t care about how fancy your design would be. UX design is NOT graphic design anymore. In your field of work,
          there is a huge possibility that you will be given existing design guidelines. So, again, UX Design is not about
          artwork, but <span class="bold">all about problem-solving</span>. UX Designer always should think <span class="bold">'am I really solving my users’ problems?'..."</span>
          </span>

          <br><br>That was such a powerful advice for me, so tried my very best to keep her words in mind whenever I approached each stages of problem solving.

      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Framing the problem</h2>
      <p>
      In this stage, I conducted <span class="bold">user research</span> and <span class="bold">competitive analysis</span> to frame the problem.
      
      <br><br>For user research, I utilized methods of <span class="bold">survey, contextual inquiry, and user interviews</span>.
      
      <br><br>For competitive analysis, I took a critical look at existing solutions within my context and analyzed 
      <span class="bold">what their pros and cons are</span> in respect to supporting my target activity.
      I particularly selected four key players in the industry, and two existing tutoring system from the UM. By doing
      this, I was able to compile a <span class="bold">list of problems or frustrating aspects of the current solutions</span>.

      <h2>Key Findings & Problem Statement </h2>
      <p>
        <br><br>Combining all data from user research and competitive analysis,
        I organized <span>key findings</span> and finally, wrote a <span class="bold">problem statement</span>.
      </p>
      <!-- <p>Before delving into next phase, I found 3 important key findings based on previous phase.</p> -->

    <!-- <section class="process">
      <h2>NEXT</h2>
      <p>To me, <span class="italic">Define</span> is the most important phase, requiring more time and effort than any
        other
        phase. <span class="bold">Defining WHO (target user), WHAT (service blueprint), HOW (method)</span>
        is the heart of problem-solving.
        <br><br>As for the first step, I asked myself, “Who is my target user?” to <span class="bold">identify my core
          users.
        </span> In this process, I grabbed 5 sticky notes and define 5 types of people who may need my service the
        most.
        Based on this, I drew a <span class="bold">user segmentation matrix </span>based on two most important factors,
        age
        and traveling style, as x and y axis criteria.
        <br><br>After, I wrote down three major tasks that such types of people would perform when they need my
        service.
        Then, I decided to choose which types of users I should focus on to define my target users. Based on the
        above-mentioned
        key findings and target users, I created <span class="bold">personas, persona scenario, </span> and <span class="bold">journey
          maps </span>to <span class="bold">identify my target users and users’ problems.</span>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Develop</h2>
      <p>In <span class="italic">Develop</span> phase, I should consider WHAT to deliver, a <span class="bold">service
          blueprint
        </span>. To do this, previous research team members gathered for an <span class="bold">ideation</span>
        sprint. Each member had 30 minutes of allotted time to come up with 50+ ideas to address users’ problems.
        <br><br>After exploring diverse ideas, I picked 5 ideas that I want to focus on and conducted <span class="bold">Funnel
          Vision
        </span>. By doing this, I was able to converge and distill ideas to evaluate them properly, and find the
        solution
        that best matched my target users. With the above-mentioned process, I finalized <span class="bold">service key
          features,
          service concept to deliver UX values.</span>
        <br><br>Based on UX values, I started developing a design concept by utilizing <span class="bold">mindmaps and
          a
          mood board.

      <h2>Process: Deliver</h2>
      <p>In <span class="italic">Deliver</span> phase, based on the previous processes, I created <span class="bold">wireframes</span>
        and had a low-fi user testing session to create final wireframe. Combining all precious feedbacks, I finalized
        <span class="bold">design</span> and completed <span class="bold">prototyping</span>.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        This project gave me two important takeaways.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">One: Although the market is red ocean, opportunities exist.</span>
        <br><br>When I was initially given the project, I worried that the great number of travel apps available might
        make
        it hard for me to come up with fresh ideas. However, I’ve found that there are always needs untapped, which
        means
        tailored research along with keen insights can always reveal opportunities.
        <br><br> <span class="bold">Two: Feedbacks make everything “so much” better.</span>
        <br><br>From UX research to design, I’ve received tons of feedback not only from users but also other designers
        or
        project managers. Users’ feedbacks are the core part of everything, helping me to fully empathize with their
        need
        so that I don't over-rely on my personal opinions. Other designers’ feedback allowed me to further consider
        details
        of my design based on professional UX and aesthetic views. Project managers’ feedback allowed me to consider
        the
        business value of my product.
