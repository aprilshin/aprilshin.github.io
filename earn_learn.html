      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The University of Michigan (UM) is a reputable, well-rounded public university with over 50,000 students and faculty members.
        One day, when I was having difficulties figuring out how to solve my website coding issues,
         I thought, 
      <br><br>‘Since we have so many intelligent students from such a wide range of disciplines, <span
          class="bold">what if I could
          have a peer helping me out on the specific problems that I’m having?’ </span>, 
          and then <span class="bold">‘What if UM
          students
          could exchange knowledge and skills according to their learning needs?’</span>

        <br><br>I decided to take this questions for my individual project in class <span class="italic">SI 582:
          Introduction to Interaction Design</span>, taught
        by <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyamccarley/">Professor McCarley</a>.
        In fact, I realized that many
        UM students had been raising similar questions when <span class="bold">they were unable to get help from school
          resources or could not find a right person to work on their problems with them.</span>


        <br><br>Based on tailored research, I finally created <span class="bold">“Earn & Learn”</span>, an application that connects UM students
        based on
        individual needs for learning. Learning subjects could be anything from courseworks to technical skills, and
        <span class="bold">students
        can be both a tutor and tutee.</span>
        <!-- The application was presented at the final presentation during the class, and
        <span class="bold">received
          an “A” in overall evaluation</span>. -->

      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p>Earn & Learn allows users to get connected among UM students in order to:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>1) exchange requested knowledge 
          <br>2) find a local credible peer tutor at an affordable price
          <br>3) become a tutor to gain teaching experience and make money

      </figure> -->
    </section>
    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I followed the user-centered approach as below:
        <figure>
          <img class="rwd-img" src="el_contents/approach.jpg" width="100%" height="auto" alt="">
          <!-- <figcaption class="figcaption">User Scenario explaining how users can achieve their goals through the
            service.</figcaption> -->
        </figure>
        <p>
          <br><br>When I approached the problem, Professor Mccarley highly emphasized the following:
          
          <br><br><span class="italic">“ ... I don’t care about how fancy your design would be. UX design is NOT graphic design anymore. In your field of work,
          there is a huge possibility that you will be given existing design guidelines. So, again, UX Design is not about
          artwork, but <span class="bold">all about problem-solving</span>. UX Designer always should think <span class="bold">'am I really solving my users’ problems?'..."</span>
          </span>

          <br><br>That was powerful advice for me that I tried my very best to keep her words in mind as I approached each stage of problem-solving.

      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Framing the problem</h2>
      <p>
      In this stage, I conducted <span class="bold">user research</span> and <span class="bold">competitive analysis</span> to frame the problem.     
      <br><br>For user research, I utilized methods of <span class="bold">survey </span> and <span class="bold">user interviews</span>.   
      <br><br>For competitive analysis, I took a critical look at existing solutions within my context and analyzed 
      <span class="bold">their pros and cons</span> in respect to supporting my target activity.
      I particularly selected four key players in the industry, and conducted competitive assessment. 
      I was thereby able to compile a <span class="bold">list of problems or frustrating aspects of the current solutions</span>.     
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>User Research: Survey & User Interviews</h2>
      <p> I initially designed survey with 30+ questions, discussed with professor,
        and narrowed it down to less than 10 key questions.
      After, I conducted interviews with 4 users.

      <p>
      I took a careful look at existing solutions within my context and analyzed their pros and
      cons in respect to supporting my target activity. I choose four key dominant players in "tutoring" industry.
      
      <br><br> After, I conducted competitive assessment to discover opportunity areas.

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Exploring the solution space</h2>
      <p>
    In this stage, I conducted the following two methods: brainstorming and ideation through sketch. In class, we had
    training about rapid brainstorming with structure with the group. We choose two axes for our design matrix and
    brainstormed based on the given instructions. This helped me a lot in expanding my ideas and developing creativity.
    
    <br><br>After the brainstorming session, I completed ideation through sketch: I sketched eight possible solutions to my design
    problems, which allowed me to think in different contexts where my system could be used to inspire new, creative ideas.
    
    <br><br>After, I sketched user storyboard to help convey our design problem and solution. By doing so, I was better able to
    sympathize with my hypothetical user, and reconsider whether my solution really will solve the user's problem.

      <h2>Finding a good solution</h2>
      <p>
        In this stage, I narrowed my scope down to focus on mobile application service.
        This is because 1) my target users, mostly students, enjoy mobile application service, 
        and 2) it is the most feasible solution in the near future.

        <br><br>I created three <span class="bold">personas</span> and one anti-personas to better understand needs and goals of my users.
        After, I picked my two primary personas and condcuted <span class="bold">story mapping</span> for a better product development.
