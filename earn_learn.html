      <h2>The Challenge</h2>
      <p>The University of Michigan (UM) is a reputable, well-rounded public university with over 50,000 students and
        faculty members.
        One day, when I was having difficulties figuring out how to solve my website coding issues,
        I thought,
        <br><br>‘Since we have so many intelligent students from such a wide range of disciplines, <span class="bold">what
          if I could
          have a peer helping me out on the specific problems that I’m having?’</span>,
        and then <span class="bold">‘What if UM
          students
          could exchange knowledge and skills according to their learning needs?’</span>

        <br><br>I decided to take this challenge for my individual project in class <span class="italic">SI 582:
          Introduction to Interaction Design</span>, taught
        by <a class="linkedin" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/tonyamccarley/">Professor McCarley</a>.
        In fact, I realized that many
        UM students had been raising similar questions when <span class="bold">they were unable to get help from school
          resources or could not find a right person to work on their problems with them.</span>

      <h2>The Solution</h2>
      <p><span class="bold">Earn & Learn</span> is an application
        that connects UM students
        based on
        individual needs for learning. Learning subjects can be anything from courseworks to technical skills, and
        <span class="bold">students
          can be a tutor or tutee.</span>
        
         <br><br> <span class="italic">Why this solution?</span> 
         <br><br> <span class="bold">1) Effectiveness of peer tutoring</span>
         <br>According to various <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nea.org/tools/35542.htm/" class="underline italic">research</a>, peer tutoring has its great benefits in higher learning achievement, improved relationships with peers, improved personal and social development as well as increased motivation.
         <br><br> <span class="bold">2) Effectivess of in-person tutoring</span>
         <br><a target="_blank" href="https://hechingerreport.org/cheaper-human-tutors-can-be-highly-effective-studies-show/" class="underline italic">Many studies</a> show that in-person human tutors can be highly effective in learning. My research also shows that the majority of students found that in-person tutoring is more helpful than online education.
         <br><br> <span class="bold">3) Fostering equality in access to in-person learning opportunities</span>
        <br>Regardless of its effectiveness, private tutoring is  expensive that many students cannot afford. By using this solution, students can have more equal opportunities in finding qualified peer tutor at affordable prices.
         <br><br> <span class="bold">4) Providing meaningful economic activity for students</span>
        <br>Tutors on the platform (anyone) can have great opportunities to gain valuable teaching experiences as well as building their own brand and business by sharing their skills.

              graphic design anymore. In your field of work,

              about
              artwork, but <span class="bold">all about problem-solving</span>. UX Designer always should think <span

        <br><br>For user research, I utilized methods of <span class="bold">survey </span> and <span class="bold">user

        I particularly selected four key players in the industry, and conducted competitive assessment.

        training about rapid brainstorming with structure with the group. We choose two axes for our design matrix and
        brainstormed based on the given instructions. This helped me a lot in expanding my ideas and developing
        creativity.

        <br><br>After the brainstorming session, I completed ideation through sketch: I sketched eight possible
        solutions to my design
        problems, which allowed me to think in different contexts where my system could be used to inspire new,
        creative ideas.

        <br><br>After, I sketched <span class="bold">user storyboard</span> to help convey our design problem and
        solution. By doing so, I was better able to
        sympathize with my hypothetical user, and reconsider whether my solution really will solve the user's problem.

          This is because 1) my target users, mostly students, enjoy mobile application service,
          and 2) it is the most feasible solution in the near future.

          <br><br>I created three <span class="bold">personas</span> and one <span class="bold">anti-persona</span> to
          better understand needs and goals of my users.
          After, I picked my two primary personas and condcuted <span class="bold">story mapping</span> for a better
          product development.

          <br><br>By using all previous efforts, I came up with three design ideas for the solution.
          I used <span class="bold">Balsamiq</span> for <span class="bold">a quick wireframing of these three ideas</span>.
          To evaluate such ideas, I conducted <span class="bold">QOC analysis (Questions, Options, and Criteria)</span>

      <br><span class="bold">4. Provide me clear information on  verification for tutors:</span> Trust and safety always matter. Users want to make sure and see that tutors were verified and trustworthy.
      <br>
      <br><span class="bold">5. Let tutors have right to initiate direct communication with potential tutees: </span> Potential tutors were concerned if users just contact them without serious interest. Also, they were concerned if other users can see too much information about them.
