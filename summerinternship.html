      <h2>My unforgettable summer at Uber</h2>
      <p>Over the summer 2019, I interned as a product designer at Uber, as part of the Uber Eats team. While completing several projects, I was mainly reponsible for proposing design solutions to tackle courier pricing comprehension problems. 

      <br><br>In the process, I closely worked with a team of UX researchers, writers, designers, PMs, and engineers and received constant feedback. It was such a wonderful opportunities for me to work, learn, and grow with one of the smartest people in the industry.

        <br><br>Due to NDA, I am not able to share detailed project materials until the product launches publicly. If you would like to learn more about my experience, <span class="bold">please feel free to reach out to me.</span>
        
        <br><br>Also, I've already published a write-up about my learnings at Uber on Medium. Enjoy! :)

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column"><br><br><span class="keytitle">1. Know what you need</span>
            <br><br><br>Users can know why they do or do not have various options on how to deliver. It might be
            depending on their location or etc. This design solution may enable users to know the reason for this,
            reducing potential confusion.
            <br><br>Also, users can be well-prepared for initial registeration as a Courier; it would let users know all
            required documentations at once before jumping into the actual process. It will help users better understand
            what to prepare to expedite the registration process.

      <p>
        <div class="row">
          <div class="column"><br><br><br><span class="keytitle">2. Know where you are </span>
            <br><br><br>By having progress bar on the top of the screen during the registration process, users can
            expect how many steps remaining in the process.
            <br><br>Also, "continue" button with the number indication functions just like progress bar, which informs
            users of what to expect and when to end the whole process.

          <div class="column"><video class="video" width="100%" src="preuber_contents/pressed_video/uber2.mp4" autoplay

        <div class="row">
          <div class="column"><br><br><br><span class="keytitle">3. Enjoy more information</span>
            <br><br><br>Users can have a better idea of their final destination, expected time, and expected earning
            before accepting the orders.
            <br><br>Also, "slide" to delivery button would create less confusion for novice users. Users also can ask
            for help and contact Uber easily whenever they encounter problems by hitting "any problem?"

          <div class="column"><br><br><span class="keytitle">4. Do what you prefer</span>

            <br><br>Some users mentioned that they would like to utilize <span class="italic">account setting
              menu</span> in order to reflect their preference when accepting calls (Driver only? Courier only?
            Preferred genders to deliever?, etc).
            <br><br>In this regard, I would like to add <span class="italic">Preference</span> tap in account setting,
            which might help such users feel more comfortable as a Courier also meet their needs. This would help users
            to have personalized experience as a Courier.

      <h2>Key Learnings</h2>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">1. Know who your core users are</span>
        <br>I am someone who always pays a lot of attention in making things look cool. The majority of my designs have always been
        based on a mockup of the most recent iPhone; I thought that was the best way to present my design. However, I was wrong.
        What’s more important is trying to have a complete understanding of my core users. Place the priority on knowing who your users are before you focus on the aesthetics of the design.

        <br><br><span class="bold">2. Be an expert on your product</span>
        <br>Even though it was only a three-month internship, people started to come find me to ask questions regarding my product,
        which made me think: “I must keep working hard to be an expert on my product once I own it. By doing this, whenever I am
        asked questions, I can be confident in my knowledge and be able to provide more valuable answers to my team.”
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">3. Be a great communicator</span>
        <br>As a designer, I must 1) listen carefully to what different stakeholders say, 2) incorporate the ideas and thoughts
        across the teams, and 3) draw a line for what should be prioritized for the core users in my design solution. In this
        regard, I tried to have every decision that I made be fully supported through sufficient communication between the
        stakeholders, the team, and myself.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">4. Be a strategic thinker</span>
        <br>International companies like Uber have countless business factors to consider, and design is not an exception. While I
        am designing, I’ve tried my very best to leverage my knowledge and previous professional experiences as an analyst and
        consultant — I found that these experiences were very helpful.
        I found that it is critical to not only present the design itself, but also clearly demonstrate why my design matters to
        the business and how it can play a strategic role within it.
        
        <br><br><span class="bold">5. Always be inspired</span>
        <br>During my internship, I met numerous people who inspired me not only as a designer but also as a person. Some inspiring
        advice I received were:
        <br><br><span class="italic">a. Find a product that you wish to spend the rest of your life on and find some great people to build it with you; 
        <br>b. Build your UX career by strategically positioning yourself;
        <br>c. Do not join the company if you do not find a passionate manager/team who is truly excited to grow you;
        <br>d. Start designing with small changes. No matter what, they ARE making changes</span>
