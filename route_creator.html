      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>As an enthusiastic traveler, <span class="bold">making itinerary takes up a lot of times and efforts.</span> Of course, Google Map is my savior in
      this, but still, I need extra papers to write down notes to manage my trip.
       Whenever there comes a few changes in my plan, I should go back to map, search places again, and compare distances to find the most efficient routes for my entire schedule.
      <br><br>I was given this project when taking full-time UX school class at Fast Campus. Fast Campus UX School is a competitive UX
      professional program in Korea like General Assembly in the U.S. Through design process, I immediately noticed there are many
      users experiencing same issues as I had. More importantly, <span class="bold">there is no satisfactory application that helps users create their own travel routes</span> despite of great amount of needs.  
      <!-- <br><br>While exploring these issues, I came up with the idea of <span class="bold">shopping cart</span>: 
      <br><br><span class="italic">“Why can't we use the concept of shopping cart in helping users to create own routes?”</span> -->
     
      <br><br>Based on tailored research with keen insights, I finally designed the
      application called, <span class="italic">Route Creator.</span> The service was nominated 3rd place among 23 others in in-class final design competition.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I utilized the double-diamond tactic for this project: <span class="italic">Discover, Define, Develop, and Deliver.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Discover</span> phase,
        the project was conducted as a team, who were also working with the same topic, travel. We conducted quantitative and qualitative research together including <span class="bold">survey, individual in-depth interviews.</span>
        Before delving into next phase, I used <span class="bold">affinity diagram</span> to organize ideas and data to draw <span class="bold">key findings.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Define</span> phase, I defined
        purpose of design: Who, What, How, by <span class="bold">identifying target user & problems</span> through <span class="bold"> user segmentation, persona scenario</span>, and <span class="bold">journey map.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Develop</span> phase, I created blueprint to solve my users’ problems by incorporating creative <span class="bold">ideation, UX strategy.</span> Based on UX strategy, I started developing design concept by utilizing <span class="bold">mind map, concept
        keyword, mood board.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Deliver</span> phase, I created <span class="bold"> wireframes </span>and had <span class="bold">low-fi wireframe session</span>, which provided me precious feedbacks from users. 
        Finally, I finalized my <span class="bold"> final design </span>and completed <span class="bold">prototyping</span>.

      <h2>Process: Discover</h2>
      <p>
        In <span class="discover-italic">Discover</span> phase, tailored research is the key. As a team-based research, we conducted <span class="bold">desk research </span>by assigning each other different focus:
        domestic trend, global trend, current popular travel app services.  
        <br><br>After the discussion with the outcomes, we conducted <span class="bold">survey </span>with
        100+ participants, and <span class="bold">individual interviews</span> to figure out current users' experiences with other travel apps and problems
        they encountered. We later, selected 4 interviewees, who gave insightful responses for <span class="bold">in-depth individual interviews.</span>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Define</h2>
      <p>To me, <span class="italic">define</span> phase, is the most important part taking longer times and efforts than any other phases. <span class="bold">Defining WHO (target user), WHAT (service blueprint), HOW (method)</span> is the heart of every problem-solving. 
      <br><br>As for the first step, I asked myself,
      “who is my target user?” to <span class="bold">identify my core users.</span> In this process, I grabbed 5 sticky notes and define 5 types of people
      who may need my service the most. Based on this, I drew <span class="bold">user segmentation matrix </span>based on two most important factors, age and traveling
      style, as x and y axis criteria. 
      <br><br>After, I wrote down three major tasks that such types of people would do when they need
      my service. Then, I decided to choose which types of users I should focus to define my target users. Then, based on the previous
      key findings and target users, I created <span class="bold">personas, persona scenario, </span> and <span class="bold">journey maps </span>to <span class="bold">identify my target users & users’ problems.</span>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Develop</h2>
      <p>In <span class="italic">develop</span> phase, I should consider WHAT to deliver, a <span class="bold">service blueprint</span>. To do this, previous research team members gathered for <span class="bold">ideation</span>
      sprint. Each member had 30 minutes of allotted time to come up with 50+ ideas which address users’ problems.
      <br><br>After exploring diverse ideas, I picked 5 ideas that I want to focus and conducted <span class="bold">Funnel Vision</span> . By doing this, I was able
      to converge and distill ideas to evaluate properly, and find the best matched solution to my target users.
      With the abovementioned process, I finalized service <span class="bold">key features, service concept to deliver UX values.</span> 
      <br><br>Based on UX values, I started developing design concept by utilizing <span class="bold">mindmap and mood board.</span>

      with all precious feedbacks, I finalized <span class="bold">design</span> and completed <span class="bold">prototyping</span>.
