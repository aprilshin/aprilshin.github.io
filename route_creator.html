      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>I am an enthusiastic traveler, but <span class="bold">making an itinerary takes a lot of time and effort</span>
        even for me.
        <br>Of course, Google Map is my savior in this, but I still often need extra papers to write down notes to
        schedule
        my trip. Whenever my plan undergoes some changes, I go back to the map, search places again, and compare
        distances
        to find the most efficient routes for my entire schedule.
        <br><br>I was given this project when taking full-time UX school class at Fast Campus. Fast Campus UX School is
        a
        competitive UX professional program in Korea, similar to General Assembly. Through the design process, I
        quickly
        noticed many users experience the same issues as I do. More importantly, <span class="bold">no satisfactory
          mobile
          application helps users create their own travel routes,</span> despite abundant need.
        <!-- <br><br>While exploring these issues, I came up with the idea of <span class="bold">shopping cart</span>: 
      <br><br><span class="italic">“Why can't we use the concept of shopping cart in helping users to create own routes?”</span> -->

        <br><br>Based on rigorous research with insightful analysis, I finally designed an application, <span class="italic">Route
          Creator.
        </span> The service was <span class="bold">nominated 3rd place</span> among 23 others in in-class final design
        competition.

      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p>
        I utilized the double-diamond tactic for this project: <span class="italic">Discover, Define, Develop, and
          Deliver.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Discover</span> phase, the project was conducted by a team, who were
        also
        working with the same topic, travel. We collaborately conducted quantitative and qualitative research including
        <span class="bold">survey</span> and <span class="bold">individual in-depth interviews.</span>
        Before delving into the next phase, I used an <span class="bold">affinity diagram</span> to organize ideas and
        data
        to draw <span class="bold">key findings.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Define</span> phase, I defined purpose of design - what, how, and for
        whom
        - by <span class="bold">identifying target users & problems</span> through <span class="bold"> user
          segmentation,
          persona scenario</span>, and a <span class="bold">journey map.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Develop</span> phase, I created a blueprint to solve my users’
        problems
        by incorporating creative <span class="bold">ideation, UX strategy.</span> Based on UX strategy, I started
        developing
        a design concept by utilizing <span class="bold">mind maps, concept keywords, and a mood board.</span>
        <br><br>In <span class="discover-italic">Deliver</span> phase, I created <span class="bold"> wireframes </span>and
        had a <span class="bold">low-fi wireframe session</span>, which provided me precious feedback from users.
        Finally,
        I finalized my <span class="bold"> final design </span>and completed <span class="bold">prototyping</span>.

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Discover</h2>
      <p>
        In <span class="discover-italic">Discover</span> phase, tailored research is key. As a team-based research, we
        conducted <span class="bold">desk research </span>by assigning each other different foci: domestic trend,
        global trend, or current
        popular travel app services.
        <br><br>After discussion of the outcomes, we conducted a <span class="bold">survey </span>with 100+
        participants,
        and <span class="bold">individual interviews</span> to figure out current users' experiences with other travel
        apps
        and problems they encountered. We later, selected 4 interviewees, who gave insightful responses for <span class="bold">in-depth
          individual interviews.</span>

      <h2>Key Findings </h2>
      <!-- <p>Before delving into next phase, I found 3 important key findings based on previous phase.</p> -->

    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Define</h2>
      <p>To me, <span class="italic">Define</span> is the most important phase, requiring more time and effort than any
        other
        phase. <span class="bold">Defining WHO (target user), WHAT (service blueprint), HOW (method)</span>
        is the heart of problem-solving.
        <br><br>As for the first step, I asked myself, “Who is my target user?” to <span class="bold">identify my core
          users.
        </span> In this process, I grabbed 5 sticky notes and define 5 types of people who may need my service the
        most.
        Based on this, I drew a <span class="bold">user segmentation matrix </span>based on two most important factors,
        age
        and traveling style, as x and y axis criteria.
        <br><br>After, I wrote down three major tasks that such types of people would perform when they need my
        service.
        Then, I decided to choose which types of users I should focus on to define my target users. Based on the
        above-mentioned
        key findings and target users, I created <span class="bold">personas, persona scenario, </span> and <span class="bold">journey
          maps </span>to <span class="bold">identify my target users and users’ problems.</span>

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process: Develop</h2>
      <p>In <span class="italic">Develop</span> phase, I should consider WHAT to deliver, a <span class="bold">service
          blueprint
        </span>. To do this, previous research team members gathered for an <span class="bold">ideation</span>
        sprint. Each member had 30 minutes of allotted time to come up with 50+ ideas to address users’ problems.
        <br><br>After exploring diverse ideas, I picked 5 ideas that I want to focus on and conducted <span class="bold">Funnel
          Vision
        </span>. By doing this, I was able to converge and distill ideas to evaluate them properly, and find the
        solution
        that best matched my target users. With the above-mentioned process, I finalized <span class="bold">service key
          features,
          service concept to deliver UX values.</span>
        <br><br>Based on UX values, I started developing a design concept by utilizing <span class="bold">mindmaps and
          a
          mood board.

      <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
      <p>
        This project gave me two important takeaways.<br><br>
        <span class="bold">One: Although the market is red ocean, opportunities exist.</span>
        <br><br>When I was initially given the project, I worried that the great number of travel apps available might
        make
        it hard for me to come up with fresh ideas. However, I’ve found that there are always needs untapped, which
        means
        tailored research along with keen insights can always reveal opportunities.
        <br><br> <span class="bold">Two: Feedbacks make everything “so much” better.</span>
        <br><br>From UX research to design, I’ve received tons of feedback not only from users but also other designers
        or
        project managers. Users’ feedbacks are the core part of everything, helping me to fully empathize with their
        need
        so that I don't over-rely on my personal opinions. Other designers’ feedback allowed me to further consider
        details
        of my design based on professional UX and aesthetic views. Project managers’ feedback allowed me to consider
        the
        business value of my product.
