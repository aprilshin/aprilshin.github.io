      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>In summer 2014, I worked as an UX consultant at Wise-UX Global Consulting Group and worked on <span class="bold">Samsung
          Global Audio project.</span>
        Samsung brought us one of their core business problems and wanted us to address and solve the issues from UX perspectives.
        Our global team was consisted of 6 other consultants, each of them were bilingual in different languages. As a bilingual
        in English, I took charge of the U.K. and U.S. markets.
      
        <br><br><span class="bold">My primary roles are:</span>
        <br><br>1. Counseled partners in strategy meetings through analysis of market trends and user experience feedbacks, highlighting
        potential product development and untapped demand of audio market in the U.S. and U.K.
        <br><br>2. Developed individualized strategy proposals for Samsung Global Audio through creating up-to-date databases of
        high-end users, reviewing firm’s marketing process and potential promotion issues in both domestic and global markets.  
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="goals">
      <h2>Problem Define</h2>
      <p>Initial problem that Samsung brought us was:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br>"... We ultimately want to make an entry into the high-end & low-end audio market. Therefore, through tailored user
          study as well as future trends analysis, we want to get help in making our best business decision before jumping into
          the market..."
        </div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>After, we re-defined the problem more specifically by asking questions like:
        <div class="goals-three">
          <br> ㆍ How can we define “high-end” and “low-end” audio market?
          <br> ㆍ What are the products included in “global audio market”?
          <br> ㆍ What are the short-term and long-term business goals?
          <br> ㆍ Are there any specific regions to focus?
        </div>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>By digging deeper into questions, we were able to clearly define the problem.
      </p>
      </section>
    <section class="approach">
      <h2>Approach</h2>
      <p> We approached the problem by utilizing 3C analysis like below. Particularly, we spent enormous times and
        efforts in conducting user study.

    <section class="process">
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>
        Due to confidentiality, I am not able to reveal the materials I created during the project. But as a quick summary about
        the process, I was able to experience both <span class="bold">conducting very tailored UX study and business strategy/marketing
          analysis</span>. It was a valuable experiences for me to spend enormous times and efforts in segmenting user types, screening
        and recruiting users as well as utilizing diverse business strategy methods in the process.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Outcomes</h2>
      <p>We successfully ended the project, and later <span class="bold">this project laid the groundwork for Samsung’s M&A (Merger and Acquisition)
          of Harman International Industries, Inc.</span>, one of the biggest audio, electronic, and infotainment systems companies
        in the world.
      
        <br><br>Some of the key features from recently-released audio products of Harman, such as smart speaker or new premium
        sound bars, were things we included in our final solutions.
      </p>
      </section>
    <section class="process">
      <h2>Final thoughts</h2>
      <p>Although Samsung has been regarded as one of the most innovative companies in the world, they are somewhat having a hard
        time in applying user-centered business strategy. Through this project, I was able to learn <span class="bold">how to incorporate
          both UX process and strategic business analysis into making core business decisions</span>.
        <br><br>As a person who has experienced several business sectors, now I am confident to say that every strategic business
        decisions cannot be freed from UX feedbacks. By looking at how Samsung is making a huge growth in the audio industry, I also feel
        responsible to become a UX professional who can provide both insightful and strategic guidance to every problem solving.
